## Configuration Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:** Open your terminal and execute the following command to clone the repository to your computer:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JDavidcor23/twitter-clone.git
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables:** In the `twitter-clone` and server `folders`, you'll find files named .env.template. Rename them to .env and edit each one with the necessary information. These files will contain the required environment variables for the project.

3. **Install Dependencies:** Open a terminal in both the `twitter-clone` and `server` folders, and run the following command to install the required dependenciess:

   ```bash
   cd twitter-clone
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

4. **Configure AWS Variables:** Configure your AWS credentials on your machine by executing the following command in the terminal:

   ```bash
   # Replace with your AWS variables
   aws configure
   ```

5. **Run project:** Once you've completed the previous steps, you're ready to run the project:
   ```bash
   # From the 'server' folder, start the server
   cd server
   npm start
   ```
   ```bash
   # From the 'twitter-clone' folder, start the front-end application
   cd twitter-clone
   npm start
   ```

That's it! You should now have the Twitter clone project up and running in your local environment.

## Running Tests

If you want to run the tests, navigate to the twitter-clone and server folders in your terminal and type the command npm run test. This will execute the configured tests in both parts of the project and provide you with insights into the application's integrity. Just like running the project, you can initiate the tests by following these steps:

:

```bash
# From the 'server' folder, start the server
cd server
npm test
```

```bash
# From the 'twitter-clone' folder, start the front-end application
cd twitter-clone
npm test
```
